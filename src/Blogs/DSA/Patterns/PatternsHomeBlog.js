        <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
        <p>
            Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software
            design. They are templates that help developers solve design problems
            efficiently and effectively. Design patterns are used to create
            maintainable, scalable, and flexible software applications.
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Design Patterns</h3>
        <p>
            There are many types of design patterns, each designed to solve a specific
            problem in software design. Some common types of design patterns include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creational Patterns</li>
            <li>Structural Patterns</li>
            <li>Behavioral Patterns</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Importance of Design Patterns</h3>
        <p>
            Design patterns play a crucial role in software development. They help
            developers create scalable, maintainable, and flexible software
            applications. Understanding design patterns helps developers write
            efficient code and design robust software systems.
