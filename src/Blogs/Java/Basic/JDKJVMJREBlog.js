      <h2>Understanding JDK, JVM, and JRE</h2>
      <p>The Java Development Kit (JDK), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) are three core components of the Java programming language.</p>
      <h3>JDK (Java Development Kit)</h3>
      <p>The JDK is a software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes the JRE, an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed for Java development.</p>
      <h3>JVM (Java Virtual Machine)</h3>
      <p>The JVM is a virtual machine that runs Java bytecode. It is a part of the JRE. The JVM is platform-independent, meaning that Java bytecode can run on any platform that has a compatible JVM.</p>
      <h3>JRE (Java Runtime Environment)</h3>
      <p>The JRE is a set of software tools for the development of Java applications. It includes the JVM, core libraries, and other components to run applications written in Java.</p>
