        <h2>Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
            An algorithm is a set of instructions or rules designed to solve a
            specific problem. It is a step-by-step procedure that defines a
            sequence of operations to be performed. Algorithms are used in computer
            science, mathematics, and other fields to solve complex problems.

        <h3>Types of Algorithms</h3>
        <p>
            There are many types of algorithms, each designed to solve a specific
            problem efficiently. Some common types of algorithms include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sorting Algorithms</li>
            <li>Searching Algorithms</li>
            <li>Graph Algorithms</li>
            <li>Dynamic Programming Algorithms</li>
            <li>Greedy Algorithms</li>
            <li>Divide and Conquer Algorithms</li>
            <li>Backtracking Algorithms</li>
            <li>Randomized Algorithms</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Importance of Algorithms</h3>
        <p>
            Algorithms play a crucial role in computer science and programming. They
            are used to solve complex problems efficiently and are the building
            blocks of software development. Understanding algorithms helps
            programmers write efficient code and optimize the performance of
            applications.
